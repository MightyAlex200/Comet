## Getting it set up
The DNA should work perfectly out of the box, but the frontend does require some set up. The only required application is [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).

First `cd` into `ui/` and install all of the packages by running `npm install`. Once you have the packages you can build everything by running `npm run build`. Once all of the files are built you can `cd` up a level and run it with `hcdev w`.

You can clean the build artifacts by running `npm run clean` in `ui`.
